# address to download the public LRG xml files

# github address


- submit a github address only to turnitin
- The github should contain a script and the documentation (e.g. README.md). The documentation should be at a standard for ISO and SOPs.
- Testing a script on both python3 and 2 as well as multiple xml files. Pytest (https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) may be helpful for this purpose.
