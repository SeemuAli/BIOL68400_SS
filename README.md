Project title
# Creating a bed file from LRG xml data
MSc BIOL68400 bioinformatics course group work


### Purpose
The python script in this repository works to extract gene coordinates from a Locus Reference Genomic (LRG) data file (xml format) and output data in a bed format.

### Build Status
The work completed. No more development after the submission deadline on 18th January, 2019.

### Code Style
Standard.

### Screenshots

### Tech/Framework used

### Features
This script simply pulls out the exons, start and end positions from a LRG xml format file.

### Code Example
 ```python
lrg2bed_test3.py {your_LRG_xml_file_name}
```
### Requirements
This script was developed and tested using Python 3.7.0. Using any other version may cause errors or faulty results. 

- Python == 3.7.0.
- pytest == X.X.

### Installation
Download the script lrg2bed_test3.py to your local computer which is equipped with the requirements. 


### API Reference
Not available.

### Tests

### How to use
 ```python
lrg2bed_test3.py {your_LRG_xml_file_name}
```
Then the output looks like this:
```python
